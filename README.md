# Predicting Corporate Bankruptcy Risk using Python-based Financial Statement Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying financially distressed companies.  Using historical financial statement data, we leverage Python's powerful data analysis capabilities to build a model that can assist portfolio managers in minimizing investment risk. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to ultimately predict the likelihood of corporate bankruptcy.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (plots) to aid in understanding the data and model performance.  These plots are saved in the project directory and include, for example, visualizations of key financial ratios over time (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `debt_to_equity_ratio.png`).  The specific outputs may vary depending on the chosen model and data used.
